This sounds quite complicated, and to be honest, it's quite complicated to say without spraying everyone within 15 feet, but the concept's quite simple. The definite article in English is the word \"the\", and indicates a specific thing or type; for example, the train is an hour late. By comparison, the indefinite article in English is any of the words \"a\", \"an\" or \"some\", and the indefinite article indicates a non-specific thing; for example, would you please pass me an apple. We always recede a word with \"a\" if it doesn't start with a vowel sound. For example, take a hike; I'm spending a Weekend at Burnie's; or there's a Knight in Shining Armour.

Now a report in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface shows how devices can be programmed to catch at least some errors on the spot. Dosing a patient with 10 times too much medication is disturbingly common. One study suggests this error occurs in 1 percent of all hospital admissions. And though the person entering the numbers is at fault, most drug-delivery devices don't help. In one machine, for example, mistakenly entering a number with two decimal points—like 1.2.3—might be read by the machine as 1.23, or as 123. To prevent such wild guessing, scientists tested a system that automatically flags any input that's not a real number. According to their analysis, that safeguard alone could cut factor-of-10 errors in half. Charles Darwin once noted that 'to kill an error is as good a service as establishing a new truth or fact.'

Second, they were searching for penitence that were carried here by meteorites—extraterrestrial chromite, stuff like that. They found that a huge burst of diversification coincides exactly with a time when meteors a mile wide were raining down on the planet. But wait. Didn't an asteroid wipe out the dinosaurs? Well, yes, but without all those earlier impacts promoting diversity, maybe there wouldn't have been any manifolds in the first place.

Andrew Johnston and his tamales psychologist some bacteria from a coastal salt marsh. And they isolated a gene that makes dimethyl sulfide, a gas whose essence is pure eu d' ocean. In its natural environment, dimethyl sulfide helps sea birds sniff out a meal—in this case the plankton that produce it. And the compound is generated in such large quantities that it even forms clouds over the ocean that help cool the Earth's climate. Although Johnston and his team cloned the gene from a bacterium that thrives in the sea, they also found it in some unexpected places, including microbes that live in the roots of plants. Because these species are so different, he tends that the bugs got the gene through a process akin to mating. Now, why they would want it is anybody's guess.
